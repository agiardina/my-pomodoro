# Nextcloud Pomodoro
A simple pomodoro app connecting to NextCloud deck api to download the list of tasks. It provides also some weekly stats to keep track of daily targets. To run it requires the [Racket Programming Language](https://racket-lang.org)

## Why another pomodoro app?
I was looking for a pomodoro app to work on tasks saved in my [Nexcloud Deck](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/deck) . I didn't find it so I coded it in few lines of Racket.

## Status
So far it is in "work on my machine" status. But maybe it works on your as well.

## How to run
Assuming you have racket in your path:
`racket main.rkt`
